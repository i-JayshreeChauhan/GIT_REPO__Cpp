/*

A student signed up for n workshops and wants to attend the maximum number of workshops where no two workshops overlap. You must do the following:

Implement 2 structures:

1- struct Workshop having the following members:
    -The workshop's start time.
    -The workshop's duration.
    -The workshop's end time.

2- struct Available_Workshops having the following members:

    -An integer, n (the number of workshops the student signed up for).
    -An array of type Workshop array having size n.

Implement 2 functions:

1- Available_Workshops* initialize (int start_time[], int duration[], int n)
    Creates an Available_Workshops object and initializes its elements using the 
    elements in the start_time[] and duration[]  parameters (both are of size n ).
    Here, start_time[i]  and duration[i] are the respective start time and duration 
    for the  ith workshop. This function must return a pointer to an Available_Workshops object.

2- int CalculateMaxWorkshops(Available_Workshops* ptr)
    Returns the maximum number of workshops the student can attendâ€”without overlap. The next workshop cannot be attended until the previous workshop ends.

Note: An array of unknown size (n) should be declared as follows:

DataType* arrayName = new DataType[n];


Input Format
------------

Input from stdin is handled by the locked code in the editor; you simply need to write your functions to meet the specifications of the problem statement above.

Constraints
-----------
1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= start_time(i) <= 10^3
0 <= duration(i) <= 10^3

Output Format
-------------

Output to stdout is handled for you.

Your initialize function must return a pointer to an Available_Workshops object.
Your CalculateMaxWorkshops function must return maximum number of non-overlapping workshops the student can attend.

Sample Input
-------------

6
1 3 0 5 5 8
1 1 6 2 4 1

Sample Output
-------------

CalculateMaxWorkshops should return 4 .

Explanation
-----------

The first line denotes n, the number of workshops.
The next line contains n space-separated integers where the ith integer is the ith workshop's start time.
The next line contains n space-separated integers where the ith integer is the ith workshop's duration.

The student can attend the workshops 0,1,3, and 5  without overlap,
so CalculateMaxWorkshops returns 4 to main (which then prints 4 to stdout).
